# Food-Bank-Program

Food banks provide support for people who are experiencing food insecurity. Working from supplies which are available, volunteers need to create hampers of nutritionally balanced food to address the needs of clients. Assembling an appropriate hamper for the number of adults and children in a family, for one week, requires knowledge of nutrition and caloric intake needs. Food banks are finding it challenging to keep track of inventory and provide families with balanced hampers. This challenge is in return including too much food in hampers so some food such as fresh produce might end up going to waste and there will be less inventory available to support other clients. To serve a greater number of people more effectively, me and three other students worked to create an application to propose ideal hampers based on current inventory.Me and my team came up with and designed an object-oriented Java application which connected to and imported data from a database using SQL, processed and outputted data according to user input, and incorporated GUI interaction with user.
